[Mann Whitney]
--------------

I pre-calculated Mann Whitney scores for each feature (rain, max temp, 
min temp) for each month, comparing readings before and after my
defined cutoff point 1991.

usage:

python oxfmannwhitneyu.py > data/oxfordmw.txt

(Note: the output file has been pre-generated so there is no
need to run this)
